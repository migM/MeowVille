Yes, we love cats! Explore cat breeds and their personalities with this app!
In the home page, you can search for the breeds you want or explore a random breed in the carousel at the bottom of the home page.

The cat results page will display the cats that have your provided input in their breed name. Clicking on them will show their details.

The cat details page will give you a small description of the breed, along with a nice picture and a graphic with the chosen cat's personality.

To run this application and have access to all the code that makes it work, we need a few things off the bat:
- GIT - Download here: ('https://git-scm.com/downloads')
> so you have access to all of GIT's functionalities and are able to clone the project directly to your machine

- Node.Js - Download here: ('https://nodejs.org/en/download')
> so you can get the packages, build, test and development server tools

- Visual Studio Code - Download here: ('https://code.visualstudio.com/download') 
> so you can mess around with the code

## Once you have these, open a command line in the desired path on your machine and copy the following command to your command line: 

`git clone https://github.com/migM/MeowVille`

## > Inside your new directory, make sure to navigate to /src/ ...

`cd .\MeowVille\src\` 

## > ... and run the command 

`npm install` 

## to get all the dependencies for the project to run as it should.

## > After the command finishes running and all packages are installed simply run the command 

`ng serve`

## > ... and open your browser on:

`http://localhost:4200`

## After that, interact with the page and it should be self-explanatory from there!

#AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED INFO:

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.2.0. Make sure your Node.Js version is ^18.13.0

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

# Further reading

## This project was developed in a short time as an answer to a code challenge. 

> Unlike the JokeChucker developed earlier, I decided to take a bit more time at the beginning developing a more concise idea on paper, looking up APIs that had more data to use and showcase, drawing up a sketch of what the app would look like and how it would work and what each screen would do. This led to a far more clear idea of the application, made breaking it up into its components faster and that much easier to develop and finding a theming structure around it all. 

> I also improved test coverage and the implementation of services for fetching data from the API and sharing data between components (which was missing from the JokeChucker), since this time around it made more sense to have that given the more complex nature of the app's behaviour. I hope this works as a better showcase of my experience.
