# MeowVille

To run this application and have access to all the code that makes it work, we need a few things off the bat:
- GIT - Download here: ('https://git-scm.com/downloads')
> so you have access to all of GIT's functionalities and are able to clone the project directly to your machine

- Node.Js - Download here: ('https://nodejs.org/en/download')
> so you can get the packages, build, test and development server tools

- Visual Studio Code - Download here: ('https://code.visualstudio.com/download') 
> so you can mess around with the code

## Once you have these, open a command line in the desired path on your machine and copy the following command to your command line: `git clone https://github.com/migM/MeowVille`

## > Inside your new directory, make sure to navigate to /src/ `cd .\MeowVille\src\` ...

## > ... and run the command `npm install` to get all the dependencies for the project to run as it should.

## > After the command finishes running and all packages are installed simply run the command `ng serve`

## ... and open your browser on:
`http://localhost:4200`

## After that, interact with the page and it should be self-explanatory from there!
